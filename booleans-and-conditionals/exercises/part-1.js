// Declare and initialize the variables for exercise 1 here:

let engineIndicatorLight =	"green blinking";
let spaceSuitsOn	= true;
let shuttleCabinReady =	true;
let crewStatus	= (spaceSuitsOn && shuttleCabinReady);
let computerStatusCode =	400;
let shuttleSpeed	= 15000;

// BEFORE running the code, predict what will be printed to the console by the following statements:

// The engine indicator is blinking red meaning the engines are off, which is what will be printed to the console



// Confirmation of mission status
